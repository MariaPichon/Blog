  <h2><a href="/Blog/blog/2015/08/28/goodbye/">Goodbye</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>It has been really interesting being part of the YWeb Cohort #2, and it&rsquo;s really sad to say goodbye to all my classmates and friends. Hopefully we will stay in touch and have meetings from time to time. Our last week of class was very interesting. Having group standups on google hangouts was an amazing experience although a bit weird since I don&rsquo;t like being on camera.</p>

  <h2><a href="/Blog/blog/2015/07/26/more-html-and-css/">More HTML and CSS</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>This week was really interisting. I keep learning so much information about HTML and CSS and I&rsquo;m very excited for the final outcome of our portfolios! Chapter03 has been tough but I think that with a little more practice I will be able to understand it better.</p>

  <h2><a href="/Blog/blog/2015/07/17/html-and-css/">HTML and CSS</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>This week has been great! I find learning about HTML and CSS a lot easier than JavaScript. I find all the coding behind a webpage/website very interesting. I&rsquo;m a little confused about when to use JavaScript and HTML but I still have learned alot! I didn&rsquo;t have time to work on chapter 3 but I will be working on it on Monday.</p>

  <h2><a href="/Blog/blog/2015/07/06/more-java-graphic-design-and-ux-conference/">More Java, Graphic Design and UX Conference</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Monday 7/6/2015: Today we finished our Scrum board workshop! It was really interesting seeing how much we can get done in just two days and the amazing things we can do to working as a team!</p>




<p>Tuesday 7/7/2015: I finally finished working on Worksheet 2. It was really challenging and I still have some questions but I am feeling much more confident about javascript and I think that if we review later and go over the questions I will get a even deeper understanding!</p>




<p>Wednesday 7/8/2015: Today was a really fun day! We had a Graphic design workshop and learned about the different properties involving it and got to create some patterns to exercise our understanding on them. I also reviewed how to push our blog posts because I had forgotten how to do it.</p>




<p>Friday 7/10/2015: Today was a really fun day! It was really informative and interesting. My favourite speech was the one that was given about generation z. Unfortunately I was only able to stay at the conference for four hours because I had to go to work afterwards but I loved the whole experience and am looking forward to something Similar again!</p>

  <h2><a href="/Blog/blog/2015/06/29/loops/">Loops</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>This week I learned a lot!I have progressed a lot in worksheet 2 but there&rsquo;s still a couple thing that i don&rsquo;t completely understand like loops. I also had lots of fun doing our first workshop. Everyone took it seriously and participated. I learned what a scrum board does and how it works. Overall week 3 was good.</p>

  <h2><a href="/Blog/blog/2015/06/26/javascript-and-mood-boards/">JavaScript and Mood Boards</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>This week I have learned a lot! We began learning about Java and a lot of the stuff we learned in chapter one is related to math. This made it very easy to learn because I think that Math is my best subject and I LOVE algebra! It was kind of challenging because we had to solve it by order of operations and there were some in which I didn&rsquo;t know which part I had to do first. We also began doing our mood boards which I found lots of fun! I created my board on pinterest which I already had experience doing. The pictures that I selected to have in my board involved fashion, music, nature, quotes and my family! overall this week went well, but We just started working on chapter 2 of our workbook and i&rsquo;m struggling a bit with it .</p>
